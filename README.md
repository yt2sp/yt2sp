# yt2sp - YouTube To Spotify

This tool synchronizes your YouTube playlists to Spotify playlists,
intelligently searching for artist & title based on the YouTube video's
name, skipping duplicates and offering the possibility for manual
overrides.

This can be useful if you use YouTube for music discovery, add the music
videos you like to a playlist and want to ensure that your discovered
items are added to Spotify as well which you use for regular music
listening.

In order to work, it requires access to your YouTube and Spotify accounts,
but it runs entirely in your browser and communicates only with YouTube
and Spotify servers and does not store any data at all.
